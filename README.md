# Prime
This project contains a script to find the list of prime numbers less than a given number and two scripts to find the prime factorization of a given number. This is also one of my earilest Python projects which let me experience the python environment.

## Usage
To find the list of prime nubmers less than a given number, do:
```bash
python3 find_prime.py
```
To find the prime factorization of a given number, do:
```bash
python3 prime_factorization.py
# or
python3 prime_factorization_two.py
```
